# Cell Behaviors on Piezoelectric Scaffolds Analyzed by Machine Learning (CPAM)  
In this repository, machine learning was employed to predict the compatibility between various cell types and a wide range of piezoelectric medical scaffolds for tissue engineering applications. The top three performing models are provided for researchers to use in their tissue engineering projects.

This project was completed in 2025.
